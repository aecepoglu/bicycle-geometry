# bicycle-geometry

An interactive bicycle frame illustrator.

Ever wondered how the specs of the bike you have been eyeballing compares to your current bike visually?  

How does a bicycle designed for front-loading compare to a Wabi fixed-gear frame?

Using this tool, you can:

1. design and visualise bicycle frames
2. save & share your designs with the public
3. compare bicycle frames

You can [use the it here](https://aecepoglu.github.io/bicycle-geometry/).

## Commonly Asked Questions

* Can I save(or print) these visualizations or measurements as an image?

_For the moment, use your browser's print functionality(`ctrl-p` or `⌘-p`). BicycleGeometryIllustrator produces pretty good print output. I will later add an easy-access button for this function._

* The bike I'm looking for is not in here

_Then you should add it here!_

  1. _Just copy & paste the information from the spec sheet to here_
  2. _Give it a name (click `✎`)_
  3. _Save it (click `⇅`)_

* I want to be able to measure X (trail, handlebar-reach, standover-height etc.)

_I will add trail calculation soon, the other measurements (which depend on more components (saddle, step, handlebar)) are within my plans._

* The illustration looks wrong

_The illustration is purely a representation of what the specs/measurements are. However there can be different ways of measuring the same component (top-tube can be measured center to center or by measuring the horizontal projection). This tool uses center-to-center measurements only and the support for alternatives will be added soon._

* I love this and I'd like to help/contribute!

_(I confess, nobody said this (yet) and I'm being presumptuous.) This project is entirely free and open and will remain that way. If you would like to help you can:_

  * _report bugs and suggest features [at the Issues page](https://github.com/aecepoglu/bicycle-geometry/issues)_
  * _contribute to the code. the `TODO.txt` file has the list of tasks_
